In this video we bring the external incident management data into the ABAP data dictionary. An External View is created in the ABAP perspective in Eclipse and then a Basic CDS view is created off of that External View.

Create a new CDS view / data definition in your ABAP project using the following code substituting "SH" for your name space:

cds view: 	orcl external data, maintenance

name:		ZXSH_I_OMAINT
desc:		ocrl external data, private interface view, maintenance	
syntax:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZXSH_IOMAINT'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: false
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'orcl external data, maintenance'
@Analytics.dataCategory: #DIMENSION               
@Analytics.dataExtraction.enabled: true 
@VDM.viewType: #BASIC
@ObjectModel.representativeKey: 'pmordernumber'

define view ZXSH_I_OMaint as select from zvsh_omaint {
    // zvsh_omaint, external view of incidents system in oracle
    key pmordernumber, 
    ehstype, 
    ehsnumber,
    ehsdescription, 
    ehstime, 
    ehsupervisorname,
    ehslocationname, 
    ehscategory, 
    ehsdatef, 
    1 as ehscount,
    //count of categories: low medium high extreme
    //separate counts for usage in s4 kpi modeler
    case
        when ehscategory = 'Low'
        or ehscategory = 'Medium'
            then 1
            else 0
        end as ehscatotherscount,
    case
        when ehscategory = 'High'
            then 1
            else 0
        end as ehscathighcount,
    case
        when ehscategory = 'Extreme'
            then 1
            else 0
        end as ehscatextremecount,
