HANA Academy Builds Your Business Solutions: Solution 1, Maintenance and Incident Dashboard

We combine S/4HANA maintenance planning data with incident management data on an external system. 
S/4 CDS is used to create a virtual data model and then we create an oData service as well as an analytic query as the consumption layer. 
S/4 Smart Business Suite (KPI's, oAnalysis, Fiori template apps) and SAP Analytics Cloud are the end user tools for the combined data.

In this particular case we use Oracle and bring the data into HANA via Smart Data Access. 
Incident data on other database's could be used in the same way.
