In this video we will create a HANA development user. This new technical user will be utilized to bring our external incident management data into the HANA database on our S/4HANA system. We will use smart data access and the data provisioning agent to create a virtual table in that technical user's new hana schema that is separate from our ERP schema.

To find more information on creating users and assigning roles and rights, or on Smart Data Integration, please see our channel at academy.saphana.com
